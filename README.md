# Twitter-Vaccine-Sentiment-Analysis
A study of public sentiment towards vaccines through analysis of Twitter data,covering the dates of 12/2020 to 11/2021. Utilizing NLP techniques to understand and categorize opinions.

## Techniques Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Data Preprocessing: The raw data was cleaned and transformed to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant information.
* Data Visualization: Graphs and charts were used to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables in the dataset.
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): The LDA algorithm was implemented to analyze the topics present in the dataset and extract meaningful insights.
* Classifiers (SVM, KNN, Random Forests): To evaluate and compare the performance of different classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forests, using BOW, TFIDF, and word embeddings features. The performance of each method was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and the following metrics:
    * Precision/Recall/F-Measure
    * Accuracy

## Future Work
* Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): The project is ongoing and the next step is to implement the LDA algorithm for further analysis and insights extraction.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a large dataset covering 12/2020 to 11/2021, using techniques and technologies from the field of data science and data mining. The results of the project are well documented and easily accessible for further use and analysis.
